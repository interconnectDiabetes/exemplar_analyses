## creds directory
The **creds** directory is a temporary solution to keeping the IP addresses of study cohorts and keys away from github. 

We put the necessary credentials to log into the opals servers in R files appropiately named with this convention:
'''<exemplar name>_creds.R'''

The creds directory is available in the "internal" directory and can be copied into your copy of the repository.
